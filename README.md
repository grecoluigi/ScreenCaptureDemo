A demo app to record the webcam, microphone and screen on macOS.  
- When capturing the webcam the preview is shown on screen.  
- The output is shown at the end of the recording.
- Very basic layout using AutoLayout for the components and autoresizingMask for the AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer

Build instructions:

- Download and open the project, change the team and Bundle Identifier
- Run the app, start a recording with all options enabled and grant permissions when asked. Relaunch the app
